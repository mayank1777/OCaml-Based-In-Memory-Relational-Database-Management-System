## OCaml-Based In-Memory Relational Database Management System

This project is a part of CS 754 course under the guidance of Prof. SUJIT KUMAR CHAKRABARTI, aiming to implement a basic Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) using OCaml. This RDBMS simulates foundational functionalities of traditional database systems but with a functional programming twist, leveraging OCaml's rich type system.

## Features
- `Basic SQL Operations`: Supports operations like CREATE, READ (SELECT), UPDATE, and DELETE.
- `Command Line Interface`: A simple command-line interface to interact with the database, allowing SQL-like commands for manipulation and queries.
- `Join Operations`: Supports basic join operations, essential for performing relational database operations across multiple tables.
- `Type Safety and Modular Design`: Utilizes OCaml's type safety and modular design principles to prevent common programming errors and enhance code maintainability.

## Prerequisites
- Ocaml

## Documentation
Includes comprehensive documentation detailing the operational use, structural configuration, and each functionality of the database. This serves as instructional material and a reference for users and developers.
